TODOs:
- remove confirmation from installation scripts (pacman, yay, etc)
- fix oh-my-zsh issue when asking to switch shell
- add fonts (nerd fonts?) - actually I think that nerd-fonts-dejavu-complete already does the job
- docker folder (/etc/docker) doesn't exist when trying to create symlink
- docker post installation scripts
- openssh
- pcman
- alsamixer-utils
- ...
